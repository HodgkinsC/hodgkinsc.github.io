Moral of the lesson of the story:
Don't wait for stuff to come to you, go out into the world and make it a better place.
Don't waste your days doing the same thing over and over, have personal projects, go out and see people.

I know it's kinda hypocritical or whatever of my whole deal but... 
I mean I make art and projects in my free time, instead of just watching videos 100% of the time. 
And I go on walks too, it's nice.

Main story idea:

Protag is waiting for a game to load when they recive a message as an invitation to go out. Protag tries to stay home anyway since they're waiting on the game to load and heavily procrastinates instead of just going out and meeting their family.

I realise this also probably reads as the person just being like, an ultra gamer or something instead of the actual thing I'm trying to communicate, so that's not very good.

Okay, I've expanded the idea. It's a more general, create art and new things for fun instead of doing nothing but waiting for entertainment to come to you.
